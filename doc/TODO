Features (maybe)
--------

+ export to sile http://sile-typesetter.org/ ? Seems to lack some features still.
+ decide on an stable API to be able to use gofrundis as a library and extend
  it easily?

Issues
------

groff mom:

+ Lk and Sx cannot be followed by a macro using -ns option: you probably never
  want to do that in practice, but it's a deviation from the manual.
+ It complains if ids contain non ascii characters in PDF_TARGET, but seems to
  work nevertheless.
